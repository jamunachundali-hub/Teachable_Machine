Supervised Learning
To create a professional GitHub README for your model, you should include an overview of what the model does, how to use it in code, and technical details about the classes it recognizes.

## Proof of Our Model:
Here is the screenshot.

### 💡 Preparation Tip
 I trained AI in three different Classes
---


## 🏷️ Classes

The model is trained to recognize the following categories:

 **1st Class: Back side of the mobile:** Identifies the mobile's back side while showing it to the camera.
 
 **2nd class: Copy/notebook:** Identifies the copy/notebook while showing it to the camera.
 
 **3rd class: Blank:** 3rd class for when no objects are present.


 # Tools Used
**Machine Learning**: To gather data and train the AI.

**GitHub:** To host the machine learning document and share this project in the Word file.

# Reflection:
This repository contains a machine learning model trained using [Google's Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). This specific model is an **Image Project** that classifies images in real time via a webcam or file uploads.
